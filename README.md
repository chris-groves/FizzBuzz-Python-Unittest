# FizzBuzz with Python and Unittest

## Intro

Aim is to introduce myself to Python by test driving the FizzBuzz kata using Unittest.

## What is FizzBuzz?

A small kata which requires the numbers 1 to 100 to be printed, with the following conditions:

1. If the number is divisible by 3, return "Fizz"
2. If the number is divisible by 5, return "Buzz"
3. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, return "Fizzbuzz"
4. Otherwise simply return the number

## Setup

1. Create a directory for the project ```mkdir FizzBuzz-Python-Unittest```

2. Enter the newly created directory ```cd FizzBuzz-Python-Unittest```

3. Create file for tests ```touch test_fizzbuzz.py```

4. Create file for working code ```touch fizzbuzz.py```

## Run Practice test

1. Create 2 files in the main directory: 'test_calc.py' and 'calc.py'

I worked through the following tutorial by Corey Schafer to introduce myself to Unittest:

To run the tests, use the following command:

```python -m unittest test_calc```
